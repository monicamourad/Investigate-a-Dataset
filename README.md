# Investigate movie dataset
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success?
This is a great place to start digging in to those questions, with data on the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues of several thousand films.
In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.

# What did I learn?
* Knew all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Became comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Knew how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* got experience communicating the results of your analysis
* used vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up data analysis code
* Became familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access data more conveniently
* Knew how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
