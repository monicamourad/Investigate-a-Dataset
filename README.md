# Investigate movie dataset
In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.

# What did I learn?
* Knew all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Became comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Knew how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* got experience communicating the results of your analysis
* used vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up data analysis code
* Became familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access data more conveniently
* Knew how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
